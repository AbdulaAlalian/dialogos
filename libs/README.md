# Packaged Libraries

This directory contains Jar files which are needed to compile DialogOS, but not available on Maven Central.

* JRendezvous.jar: seems to be an old version of jmDNS, see Issue #16.
* pocketsphinx.jar: The Swig Java bindings for PocketSphinx; see the Wiki page on rebuilding PocketSphinx.
